# hello-world
This is my first ever repository :D 

Hey, I am Anshul, and today is my first day on github 

Lmao I was struggling how to move my sentences to the next line on the preview output section, turns out we just need a blank line in between xD

I used '/n'(immediate C/C++ instinct :P)

**Bold stuff**

Nice

*italicized stuff*  
>Apparently this is a blockquote, what is it?
